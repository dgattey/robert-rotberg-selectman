    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="leader">Lexington is well-run. In order to build firmly upon the sensible and responsive governance momentum fostered by current and recent Boards of Selectmen, the town needs someone with extensive executive and fiscal know-how and a wealth of relevant experience both in and outside Lexington.</p>
    <p class="leader">As a long-time Town Meeting member, a former member of the School Committee, and a former college president, I can help to make the necessary tough decisions that will continue to define Lexington as a community of excellence and innovation.</p>

        <h2>A Strong Leader</h2>
        <p>Deb Mauger was a strong and able chair of the Board of Selectman. To succeed her, we need someone to strengthen many of our excellent policies, maintain the high quality of our schools and our services, spend needed money on roads and other infrastructural needs, make sure that all of our town citizens are served equally well, closely examine and bolster our industrial and commercial base, continue our strict budget policies, and become more “green” and more environmentally sensitive. We will be tested severely by a number of costly capital needs – new schools, new police headquarters, and a new fire station.</p>
        <p>Given my experience and background, I can help make those tough choices, the better to keep Lexington excellent.</p>

        <h2>About Bob</h2>
        <p>I have been a Lexington resident since 1970s and been active in town affairs and town politics since 1973, when I was first elected to Town Meeting in Precinct 3. (I am still a Town Meeting Member from the same precinct.) In 1974, I was elected to the School Committee.  I also served in the 1970s as Moderator of the Concerned Citizens for the Lexington Public Schools (CCLPS) and President of Five Fields Inc.  More recently, I was a member of the School Committee Policy Sub-Committee, charged with updating official policies.</p>
        <p>My late wife Joanna taught emotionally challenged students for many years at the Hastings and Bridge Schools. Our three daughters, Rebecca, Nicola, and Fiona, all went through the Lexington schools and graduated from Lexington High School.</p>
        <p>At the request of Paul Tsongas, newly elected as a reform commissioner of Middlesex County, in 1972-73 I chaired an MIT committee that recommended drastically down-sizing and modernizing the administration of the County. Nearly all of the committee’s recommendations were enacted, resulting in a sleek, less corrupt, more efficient County. I subsequently worked closely with Tsongas when he served as Congressman and then as Senator.</p>
        <p>I have written books and articles on the politics and history of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, on governance, on political leadership, on legislative redistricting, and on local government and town meeting governance in New England.</p>
